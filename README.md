## Overview

This is a solution to the [Contact form challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/contact-form--G-hYlqKJj).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

Above are the screenshot of my solution. I use an extension on chrome called goFullPage to take the screenshot, then I cropped and optimised them to my taste.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learnt to write a function for validating radio group. it will display error message when one of the radio group items is not selected.

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

I use separate validation for each groups of inputs, radio, message and checkbox which makes my code bucky and much to me but I have the impression that their will be ,uch more easier way to do it which I am looking forward to learning it.
